<p>Abstractâ€”Summarization  has  long  been  a  significant  area  of concern in the field of Natural Language Processing, mostly due to  the  its  dependency  on  human  intervention.  In  this  study,  we use  a  denoising  autoencoder,  BART,  to  carry  out  abstractive summarization on the dataset of COVID-19, using ROUGE scores as an evaluation metric. The primary focus of the study has been the  use  of  medical  articles  based  on  COVID-19,  which  is  aimed to provide a significant support for the research purpose during the  pandemic.</p>
